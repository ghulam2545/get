Single Responsibility - a class should only have one responsibility. Furthermore, it should only have one reason to change.

Dependency Inversion - The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
